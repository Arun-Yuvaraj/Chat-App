# Chat-App
Chat application with python, flask, postgresql

Link to the app - https://navrun.herokuapp.com/

Future works - 
  - Broadcasting initial users name to new users
  - Adding personal chat features
  - Removing users from online chat when they logout
  
Issues - 
  - As I used heroku's basic plan, there is a limit of max 20 connections and I had to kill all the connections as soon as the limit is reached. So, if you find error stating : "Internal Server Error", please let me know, i will kill the connections and then you can start again.

As the chats are not being saved to daatabase, you will not be able to see a message if you change room and come back
